    <h3 class="subtitles">Adaptations</h3>
    <p>This bears are great swimmers, they use their front paws which are slightly webbed and traveled swimming even though they would float on sheets of ice. Since they live in a very cold environment their thick layer of fur grows even on the bottom of their paws. Their fur's color is white to camouflage in the ice and snow, even though their skin is black.</p>
    <h3 class="subtitles">Lifestyle</h3>
    <p>This type of bears are carnivores and typically eat seals. They frequent the places where seals go up from the water to breath air, this bears could also feed out of the carcasses of dead animals like dead whales. They are like the kings of this environment. Female polar bears usually dig a deep hole in the snow to provide protection to it's cubs. This specie usually gives birth to twins and most likely in the winter season. The mother is usually the one who teaches them everything they need to know to survive, the father usually doesn't help at all in taking care of the cubs. They usually don't fear humans so would probably act agressively towards them.They have strong and sharp claws that helps them a lot with their food and survival.</p>

    <h3 class="subtitles">Adaptations</h3>
    <p>Since the desert is almost always dry this camels do many things like close their nostrils so sand won't get in, they also have bushy eyebrows and two pair of eyelashes to avoid getting sand on the eyes. They also have tough lips to be able to get the dry and thorny vegetation that is found in the desert. They have thick footpads that helps them walk on the rough rocky terrain and the sand. Their hump can store up to 80 pounds of fat that helps them later on when there is no water or food, they break it down into water and energy. These camels don't sweat as easily which is convenient for them because they can store water longer periods of time.</p>
    <h3 class="subtitles">Lifestyle</h3>
    <p>These camels are mostly shy at first and are usually found in groups of 4 or 6. The male is usually the one who directs the family and watches from the back, while the women take turns to lead. They walk on a line one behind the other, they greet each other by blowing each other's face. These type of camels have been domesticated for many years by now which shows that are not dangerous as other animals. Humas value these animals because they can carry many things at a time for a long distance.</p>

    <h3 class="subtitles">Adaptations</h3>
    <p>Their feet are made for traveling, having five toes on the front paws and 4 toes on the back paws. Their teeth can tear into flesh really easily, and their back teeth can break bones just as easy. They could store most of the food they eat for the times where they don't eat. Their sense of smell can be 100 times better than the human's sense of smell and their hearing sense up to 20 times better than the human. They also have thick fur which helps them in the cold.</p>
    <h3 class="subtitles">Lifestyle</h3>
    <p>This type of wolves are always in packs of around six or ten of them, they might roam around 12 miles in a day. They eat a variaty of animals like deer, elk, moose and might also eat smaller animals like birds, fish, lizards, snakes and also fruit. Even though they can go a week without eating. </p>

    <h3 class="subtitles">Adaptations</h3>
    <p>When there is a lot of wind they huddle together to keep warmth, we could say they rotate between individuals to go in the middle which creates warmth and once they are warm they move to the outside of the circle to let someone else get warm. Even though it gets very cold on the winter they breed during this time, females would only lay one egg and leave for a hunting trip. This trip usually takes up to two months because they have to travel up to 50 miles to get to the open ocean. Once the females are there they look to eat fish, squid, and krill. To get to these food they can dive up to 1,850 feet and could stay around 20 minutes under water.</p>
    <h3 class="subtitles">Lifestyle</h3>
    <p>The male penquins are the ones that stay behind taking care of their egg and keep them warm. While they take care of their egg males don't eat anything until the females come back with food for the new baby penguin and they could leave to the open ocean to look for food for themselves. Once the males leave the females have to keep warm to the new penguins with their brood pocuhes just like the males did when the females were gone because if not the new baby penguins would die really fast. When the Antartic summer comes the new penguins are ready to swim and fish on their own.</p>

    <h3 class="subtitles">Adaptations</h3>
    <p>Most of this type of goats live in the alpine environments of North America, they have very spectacular climbing skills that leave many animals and humans behind. This goats have cloven hooves with two toes that help them be more balanced, their toes have rough pads that help them have a better grip to climb mountains. They can jump up to 12 feet in only one jump. Their beards are long and protects them from the cold mountain winds and during the summer season they shed this coat of fur. </p>
    <h3 class="subtitles">Lifestyle</h3>
    <p>Females of this specie spend most of the year with their kids, males usually live alone or with around other 2 or 3 males, Both males and females have pointed horns and in mating season some of the male would use them to battle rivals who could steal their mate. These goats mostly eat plants, grasses, mosses and other alpine vegetation.</p>
